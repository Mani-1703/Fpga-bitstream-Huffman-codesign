# Fpga-bitstream-Huffman-codesign
Hardware–software co-designed lossless compression and lightweight protection framework for AMD/Xilinx FPGA bitstreams using Huffman coding, implemented with custom AXI-Lite IP cores in Verilog and system control in AMD Vitis, with end-to-end verified decompression on Zynq-7000 (ZedBoard).
